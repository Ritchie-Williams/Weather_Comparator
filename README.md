TO USE:

1. Create a text file and enter API Key, followed by Link 1, then Link 2 seperated only by commas

Link 1: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=

Link 2: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=

ex: api_key,http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=,http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=

2.  Run the program and enter the path to the Text File

   Everything should run as functioned

Note: Copying a filepath directly from File Explore will place quotations around the FilePath causing an error in the Program. Removing the quotations should fix this problem. 

Thank you!
